Since 2020 I am working as a bioinformatician at the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/) in Bern, and as a bioinformatics trainer at the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/training). You might also know me from [glittr.org](https://glittr.org) or my involvement in several initiatives related to training at [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/). Every once in a while I also pick up projects at a [freelance](freelance.qmd) basis.
