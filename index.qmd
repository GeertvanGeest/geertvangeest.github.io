### Would you like to collaborate on projects<br> related to bioinformatics or education?

<br>

Since 2020 I am working as a bioinformatician at the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/) in Bern, and as a bioinformatics trainer at the [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss). You might also know me from [glittr.org](https://glittr.org) or my involvement in several initiatives related to training at [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/). Every once in a while I also pick up projects at a [freelance](freelance.qmd) basis.

### My work at Bern University

At the [IBU](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/) I work in close collaboration with the Veterinary science faculty [Vetsuisse](https://www.vetsuisse.unibe.ch/) to support several projects. These projects are related to dog cancer variant analysis, single cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics. They are all projects in which we apply cutting-edge techniques to non-model organisms, like dogs, cats and cows. 

### My work at SIB

At the [SIB Training group](https://www.sib.swiss/training-group) I teach courses on next generation sequencing (NGS), variant analysis, single cell transcriptomics and reproducible science. Find all my courses and their material at [Courses](courses.qmd). At SIB I am also involved in several project related to FAIR training. For example, I co-lead the [FAIR training handbook](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-FAIR-training-handbook/) initiative and I am the creator of [Glittr.org](https://glittr.org), which was recently nominated as [SIB Remarkable Output](https://www.sib.swiss/news/discover-the-sib-remarkable-outputs-2023). 

### Previous experience

Before I moved to Bern in 2020, I did my masters and PhD at Wageningen University at the [Plant Breeding](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/plant-research/plant-breeding.htm) research group. There, I developed tools for molecular breeding in chrysanthemum. Amongst others, I co-developed the package [polymapR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/polymapR/index.html), a software package to create genetic linkage maps of outcrossing polyploids. After my PhD, I worked on molecular marker development for [Deliflor Chrysanten B.V.](https://deliflor.nl) a company specialized in developing new varieties of chrysanthemum.
